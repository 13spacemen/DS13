			<h2 class="date">27 June 2020</h2>
			<h3 class="author">Nanako updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="experiment">Fixed a major calculation bug that was causing necromorph charge attacks to move at roughly half of their intended speed. Some of the speeds have been tweaked to compensate, but overall charging necromorphs move significantly faster now.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed charge attacks being broken</li>
				<li class="tweak">Reduced windup time and increased flight speed on leaper leap.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Charge attacks with autotargeting now pick targets from a 2 tile radius around the clickpoint( previously 1 tile)</li>
				<li class="tweak">Redesigned the signal Absorb ability, now with AOE suction, neat visual effects, and can be used around the marker even without corruption!</li>
				<li class="tweak">The necromorph spawning menu is now sorted in ascending order of biomass cost.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Biomass cost of Exploder significantly increased, from 50 to 65</li>
				<li class="tweak">Biomass cost of Leaper slightly reduced, from 85 to 80</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lurker biomass cost increased from 50 to 55</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lurker windup and cooldown times on spine launch slightly reduced</li>
				<li class="tweak">Lurker spine damage slightly increased, from 13 to 14</li>
				<li class="tweak">Base biomass reclamation time set to 8 minutes for most necromorphs</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slasher biomass cost reduced from 55 to 50. It is now the cheapest of all necromorphs and will remain so.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slasher biomass reclamation time slightly increased from 7.5 mins to 8 mins</li>
				<li class="tweak">Twitcher biomass cost slightly reduced, from 130 to 120</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Removed ancient slasher from spawning menu. It can still spawn as a random variant of a slasher.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Humans will now block melee attacks and thrown objects, either with held items or their own arms. Blocking is automatic as long as you face towards the source of the attack, but grab/harm intent will make it more effective. This is a huge increase in human survivability, and several other balance changes have been made to offset it.</li>
				<li class="soundadd">Blocking attacks now has visual and audio effects.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Melee attacks are now guaranteed to hit, both human and necromorph. The new blocking system replaces evasion in melee combat. This change does not affect projectiles or firearms.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly increased the damage of many necromorph attacks</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly reduced the armor values of vintage rig, security rig, and riot armor.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Greatly buffed all forms of shields, especially riot shields. However, all held items - including shields - will take damage when used to block attacks, and eventually break.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Reduced the number of unitologists that will be picked at roundstart, and during low population times. Increased the maximum limit for high population times.</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed various issues that occur when a signal or marker player disconnects and reconnects.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Significantly increased the damage dealt by thrown objects. Chucking things at necromorphs is a pretty valid combat style now..</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added the Heavy Pulse Rifle, a powerful new weapon, currently only obtainable through adminspawning.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Snypehunter007 updated:</h3>
