			<h3 class="author">Nanako updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="tweak">Divider puppets can no longer speak common, but will speak on the necrochat instead. Their body will make telltale wailing sounds when they do, so keeping quiet is key to going unnoticed.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added an audible new Signal Ability!</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Necromorphs now take 10% of incoming damage as Lasting Damage, which does not heal and effectively reduces their maximum health.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Slightly buffed the max health of divider, spitter, slasher, leaper and lurker, to partially compensate for the above.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added two new necromorph healing spells - one for signal, and one for marker. Both come with their own drawbacks, but can regrow lost limbs on live necromorphs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Snypehunter007 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Given all bridge staff general belts.</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Nanako updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed issues where cyst rotation wouldn't work in certain circumstances. It should now be fully reliable unless the chat entry area is focused</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Exploder is back and explodier than ever!</li>
				<li class="tweak">Object-based shooting abilities now hit a random part of the target instead of always the chest. This currently affects detonator, harvester, and cyst</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the rivet gun's fragmentate mode not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed the rivet fragments' damage, from 1.8 to 2.2</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed detonator crate being wrongly named in cargo interface.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Majorly increased radiation resistance on the engineering rig.  Dedicated radsuits are still slightly better though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Generic pouches now have more reasonable storage capacity</li>
				<li class="tweak">Handcuffs now work on people wearing rigs. This feature was originally designed on baycode where rigs were a rare item</li>
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed sheets in storages getting stuck on screen when merging</li>
				<li class="tweak">Material stacks can now fit inside ordinary storage compartments.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebalanced tool degradation, power use, and failure rates, to generally be more forgiving. Chance of critical failures especially majorly reduced.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed issues of getting stuck when launching out of disposals</li>

			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">Terror4000rus updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed ghost's prefix about the characters real name. So, no more things like '(F)Cody Green/(Unknown(as Cody Green): Cody Green screams!' The prefix will appear only if the character's visual name is 'Unknown' or 'Unknown (as not-real-name)'.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 class="author">TheLion1675 updated:</h3>
			<ul class="changes bgimages16">

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed a bug where anyone who would have escaped being marked as marooned on the USG Ishimura.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Windows for the escape shuttles are now indestructible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Three new end-of-round statistics added as well as variations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All of the ERT shuttles are now marked post-round safezones. This adds onto the escape methods, if you were inclined to give that a shot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added teleportation if anyone runs out of a shuttle while it is in transit. Should you do this, you will now be warped into space, and your death will be assured. Don't do this.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Rework of how escape shuttles work and act. Those who are in the pods now, will be able to walk around on a planetary landing site. If you're really lucky, it won't be infested.</li>
				<li class="experiemnt">Experimental fix for laptops, tablets and PDA's refusing to work after evacuating.</li>
				<li class="wip">Added in appropriate area and landmarks for the Administrative Shuttle. The code for this will likely be included in the same update by KMC.</li>
