				<li class="bugfix">Fixed the rivet gun's fragmentate mode not working.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Buffed the rivet fragments' damage, from 1.8 to 2.2</li>

				<li class="tweak">The discord button in the UI is now normally colored.</li>

				<li class="bugfix">Fixed detonator crate being wrongly named in cargo interface.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Majorly increased radiation resistance on the engineering rig.  Dedicated radsuits are still slightly better though.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Generic pouches now have more reasonable storage capacity</li>
				<li class="tweak">Handcuffs now work on people wearing rigs. This feature was originally designed on baycode where rigs were a rare item</li>

				<li class="tweak">Material stacks can now fit inside ordinary storage compartments.</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="bugfix">Fixed ghost's prefix about the characters real name. So, no more things like '(F)Cody Green/(Unknown(as Cody Green): Cody Green screams!' The prefix will appear only if the character's visual name is 'Unknown' or 'Unknown (as not-real-name)'.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Windows for the escape shuttles are now indestructible.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Three new end-of-round statistics added as well as variations.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">All of the ERT shuttles are now marked post-round safezones. This adds onto the escape methods, if you were inclined to give that a shot.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Added teleportation if anyone runs out of a shuttle while it is in transit. Should you do this, you will now be warped into space, and your death will be assured. Don't do this.</li>
				<li class="experiment">Rework of how escape shuttles work and act. Those who are in the pods now, will be able to walk around on a planetary landing site. If you're really lucky, it won't be infested.</li>
