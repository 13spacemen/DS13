  Nanako:
  - experiment: Added the Infector, a complex new support necromorph with abilities
      to convert humans, construct corruption nodes, heal and buff other necromorphs.
  - rscadd: Added necrotoxin, a poison that converts its victims into necromorphs
      if it kills them. Necrotoxin is applied by all infector attacks.
  - tweak: Reworked chemical metabolism rates. The base rate is a bit slower, but
      now chemicals metabolize faster, the larger the quantity is in a patient's system.
