changes: 
  - rscadd: "Necromorphs now take 10% of incoming damage as Lasting Damage, which does not heal and effectively reduces their maximum health."
  - tweak: "Slightly buffed the max health of divider, spitter, slasher, leaper and lurker, to partially compensate for the above."
  - rscadd: "Added two new necromorph healing spells - one for signal, and one for marker. Both come with their own drawbacks, but can regrow lost limbs on live necromorphs."
