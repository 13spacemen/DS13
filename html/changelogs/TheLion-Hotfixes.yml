changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where grass tiles would appear as nothing."
  - bugfix: "Fixed Hydroponics erroneously showing up as Decommissioned still."
  - bugfix: "Fixed runes not being able to be cleaned by normal means."
  - bugfix: "Aegis asteroid turfs now spawn materials. This also means the mining drill is functional again, and can be used on all turfs. The rewards will be entirely arbitrary."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the ability to disposal lockers."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a rare occurence of spaced players finding their way onto old, deprecated Bay away sites."
  - rscdel: "Removed bags of holding as a valid research creation option."
  - rscdel: "Removed a few xenoarcheology clothing spawns. These were outdated and didn't fit within the universe."
  - rscdel: "Removed a few lunchbox items that were unable to be reworked properly, and were against lore."
  - rscadd: "Added security camera's to Hydroponics."
  - imageadd: "Reworked several lunchboxes to be more lore appropriate."
  - maptweak: "Updated Aegis mines. Ore generation is now completely arbitrary and random within areas specified."
  - maptweak: "Aegis is now surrounded by impassable rocks. This prevents seeing space if you get close enough to the edge."
  - tweak: "Moderate increase to recharger rates, to prevent the eternal waiting spree of hell."
  - tweak: "Moderately decreased liver damage sustained from drinking alcohol. This is not a fix for your overindulgence."
  - tweak: "The ability to drop bombs has now been set to +PERMISSIONS level, which is head devs, head admins and the (vice) host."
  - experiment: "Significant increase to random ore generation. Aegis 7 should now be more canonical to lore in being mineral rich. Please report issues to Lion."
