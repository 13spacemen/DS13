changes: 
  - rscadd: "EDF Marines now get high velocity pulse rounds, which are more powerful all around and look pretty cool too! HV magazines can very rarely be found in random loot aboard the ishimura."
  - rscadd: "EDF Marines now get either a seeker rifle or heavy pulse rifle, in addition to their normal rifle, in their lockers aboard the USM valor"
  - tweak: "Fixed a bug where gun cabinets would not have the correct icon at roundstart."
