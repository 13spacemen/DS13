Harvester

The harvester is the first node designed for gaining biomass. In a limited and situational manner.

The harvester is mostly indestructible, direct fire doesn't hurt it. The only way that humans can get rid of it, is by removing nearby corruption sources. With no source to feed it, the harvester stops working, starves and dies. This will naturally take several minutes, during which necromorphs can rush to its defense.

Being indestructible, they could be used as a wall. but their high initial biomass cost (50) makes this unfeasible.


The harvester gains biomass in a few ways:

1. Absorbing.
	Identical to the signal ability Absorb, it can consume dropped limbs, organs, and bloodstains to gain small amounts of biomass. It will do this automatically. So its good to build at the front of your defensive line where such things will be dropped.

2. Rapid Consumption
	Any bodies within a certain range of a harvester will be consumed 50% faster. This effect stacks with overlapping. The harvester itself does not consume them, a maw or marker is still needed for that.
	This does not increase the total biomass that will be gained from a corpse, just extracts it faster.
	
	
3. Biomass Objectives
	The main purpose of the harvester. It extracts biomass from certain objective objects within its range, gaining a flat quantity per second which has no limit. This extraction is paused when the harvester is no longer on supported corruption
	
	Valid objective objects are:
		Hydroponics trays
		Morgue drawers
		Cryostorage freezers
		Cloning tanks (in the bioprosthetic lab)
		
	Only one harvester can extract from each objective object. Building multiple harvesters does not stack in their overlapping areas. Although you might need more than one to fully cover all the harvestable objects in a room
