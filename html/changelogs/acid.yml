changes: 
  - rscadd: "Necromorph acid can now damage clothing. Any acid that doesn't reach the skin will splash onto worn equipment instead, gradually eating through it. As equipment takes damage, it lets more chemicals through. Items can also be damaged enough to be completely destroyed. This effect applies to all sources of acid. Puker, Spitter, Cysts"
  - tweak: "Biosuits and labcoats are now extremely resistant to acid."
  - tweak: "Guns are now immune to acid, and won't melt."
  - tweak: "Tools now take damage from acid instead of just melting outright."
  - tweak: "Acid patches on the ground now only cause damage above a certain visibility. No more taking damage from acid you can hardly see. Examining the patch will tell whether or not its safe to walk on."
  - bugfix: "Fixed puker acid patches not drying up over time"
  - bugfix: "Acid pools can no longer be pulled around."
