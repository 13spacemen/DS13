changes: 
  - experiment: "Humans will now block melee attacks and thrown objects, either with held items or their own arms. Blocking is automatic as long as you face towards the source of the attack, but grab/harm intent will make it more effective. This is a huge increase in human survivability, and several other balance changes have been made to offset it."
  - soundadd: "Blocking attacks now has visual and audio effects."
  - experiment: "Melee attacks are now guaranteed to hit, both human and necromorph. The new blocking system replaces evasion in melee combat. This change does not affect projectiles or firearms."
  - tweak: "Slightly increased the damage of many necromorph attacks"
  - tweak: "Slightly reduced the armor values of vintage rig, security rig, and riot armor."
  - rscadd: "Greatly buffed all forms of shields, especially riot shields. However, all held items - including shields - will take damage when used to block attacks, and eventually break."
