changes: 
  - bugfix: "Fixed an issue where in some instances the end of round music would suddenly switch track. Simplified the code it runs on, and this issue should no longer occur."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where Necromorphs were erroneously counted as surviving crew at the end of the round."
  - bugfix: "Fixed a bug where anyone who would have escaped being marked as marooned on the USG Ishimura."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an uncommon issue where players would be randomly teleported into z-levels with no movement possible at all, if they reached the edge of the level. i.e. Aegis VII."
  - bugfix: "Fixed only suit cyclers being present in Aegis Engineering and Medical Post. One of them is now a cycler, the other a storage unit."
  - bugfix: "Fixed an issue where alive mobs weren't counted as surviving or evacuated crew if the player had ghosted before the calculations occur."
  - tweak: "Windows for the escape shuttles are now indestructible."
  - rscadd: "Three new end-of-round statistics added as well as variations."
  - rscadd: "All of the ERT shuttles are now marked post-round safezones. This adds onto the escape methods, if you were inclined to give that a shot."
  - rscadd: "Added teleportation if anyone runs out of a shuttle while it is in transit. Should you do this, you will now be warped into space, and your death will be assured. Don't do this."
  - experiment: "Rework of how escape shuttles work and act. Those who are in the pods now, will be able to walk around on a planetary landing site. If you're really lucky, it won't be infested."
  - wip: "Added in appropriate area and landmarks for the Administrative Shuttle. The code for this will likely be included in the same update by KMC."
