changes: 
  - rscadd: "Necromorphs now recieve a 15% reduction to all incoming damage, while standing on corruption. Should help against spawncamping crew assaults."
  - tweak: "Increased the strength of movespeed effects from walking on corruption. Necromorph movespeed bonus from 20 to 25%, human speed penalty from 35 to 40%"
  - tweak: "Bladed necromorph basic attacks (Slasher, spitter, twitcher, enhanced slasher) now have minor armor penetration, making them better against crew in tough suits."
  - tweak: "Slasher max health slightly increased, from 75 to 80. Enhanced slasher adjusted proportionately"
  - tweak: "Slasher biomass reclamation time reduced, from 8 minutes to 7, enhanced from 12 to 11"
  - tweak: "Reduced harvester health regen, from 1 to 0.75, should make it easier to kill with sustained assault."
