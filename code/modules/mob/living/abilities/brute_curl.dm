/*
	Brute curl up.
	Not really an attack, triggered automatically by necromorph brute

	While curled up, the brute has 75% more front and side armor, and that armor no longer exposes weak spots in the front.
	However, the brute can't see, move or turn while curled, and its back is still as exposed as ever
